The data is not perfect, there is often a source of noise, this could be network latency

y = mx + c

This describes a straight line relationship, where y is the y axis variable and x is the x axis variable, the relationship between them is defined as m where m is the slope of the line. c is a constant or intercept where the line meets the y axis

Is a supervised machine learning technique [EXPAND]
