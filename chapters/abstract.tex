For this project the task was to predict the age of an individual abalone based on a set of physical characteristics. To do this python 3, along with jupyter notebook were used. Libraries used include, scikitlearn for machine learning models and matplotlib and seaborn for graphing results. Throughout this document we assess the advantages and disadvantages of linear and decision tree regression. 

Included also are the steps taken in trying to predict the age of an abalone, from eradicating erroneous data to identifying new features. Unfortunately the results for linear, ridge and lasso regression were not good, leading to the conclusion that linear regression is not a good predictive model for this dataset. However decision tree and random forest regressions performed much better.
